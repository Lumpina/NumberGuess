## Mini Game

This is a Number Guessing Game where the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100. Your goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.

The game gives you hints — it tells you if your guess is too high or too low — until you find the correct number. It also keeps track of how many tries it takes. Simple, fun, and replayable!
